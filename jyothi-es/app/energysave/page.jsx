              There are many means of improving the energy efficiency of a power
              plant – from the replacement of a single component to complete
              modernisation or operation and maintenance solutions. There are
              also many aspects that affect a plant’s energy efficiency, and
              these need to be examined before choosing the suitable improvement
              solution. Some key factors are fuel consumption, fuel price, price
              of electricity in the operating area and the maximum output of the
              plant. The first thing to look at is the engine – specifically the
              fuel system. What fuel does the plant use – oil or gas? What
              quality is the fuel, and does it correspond to the original
              parameters used in the construction phase of the plant? The
              condition of the engine and the fuel injection system is also very
              important – have they been properly maintained or left to gather
              dirt and crust? Charge air and removal of exhaust gas, as well as
              the condition of the boiler play a role too. The cooling system,
              specifically the quality of the cooling water, can also impact
              energy efficiency. Has it been purified to a sufficient extent?
              The next aspect is the operation of the plant. Is it operated
              according to the original parameters, or has the plant operator
              changed the operating profile to match changed needs? Does the
              number of engines match the customer need, and are they being run
              at an optimal load or is the load too high or low? Regular
              maintenance is naturally an important factor, as well. In some
              cases, the plant operator already knows where the challenges are,
              while in others, there are more open questions. In the latter
              situation, a site audit conducted by energy efficiency experts
              helps identify equipment and processes with improvement potential.
              In all cases, technical schematics of the plant and its designed
              operating parameters, as well as all available operational data
              are examined to ensure that there is sufficient information for
              selecting the best improvement solution.
