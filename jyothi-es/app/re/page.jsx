              Reverse engineering makes it possible to quickly reproduce spares
              that are hard to find or no longer available.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              When an original manufacturer no longer exists or no longer makes
              a part you need, it can have a huge impact on your production
              capacity. Having to get the part replaced adds more stress as it
              can lead to excessive down time and potentially also decreased
              machine efficiency.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              You are in urgent need of a spare part to keep your system
              running. However, the manufacturer may no longer offers spare
              parts. The delivery period may be too long. Or you may wish to
              replace parts with new components with an improved
              structural/higher-grade MOC. In all these situations, SJES is best
              choice for reverse engineering solutions for all static or
              rotational equipment’s. Whether the part to be changed is a
              casting, a turned part, a milled/welded element- thanks to reverse
              engineering the reproduction of spare parts is straight forward –
              irrespective of the make. All you have to do is arrange sample of
              the part for 3D scanning for developing drawing for couple of
              hours. Even badly worn parts also we can repair like original
              condition by using best repair techniques and if required we can
              reproduced like in original condition.

              Our Reverse Engineering Process
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The first step to producing a replacement part is to construct a
              computer aided drawing (CAD) of the part needing replacement. The
              CAD drawing is important as it provides a reference for the
              machinist to compare the final part to. The CAD drawing also
              provides the geometry required to produce tool paths with
              professional computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software. At this
              stage changes can be made to the design to better suit your use
              case.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              To create the CAD drawing, we are using 3D scan technology for
              scan the object to draw up the part. 3D scanning is a great tool
              for complex parts
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The tool paths from the CAD drawing are then finalised and
              converted to G-code. The G-code is tested before beginning any
              machining operation on stock to prevent damage and make sure that
              the program runs as intended.

              The final step involves checking that the part or parts are all of
              high quality and reflect the original they are based on.
